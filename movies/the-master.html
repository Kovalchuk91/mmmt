<p>I was really impressed by the acting game of the Joaquin Phoenix in the recently released Joker. I immediately wanted to see another film with him so my choice fell on The Master directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. And the film hasn't disappointed me. In addition to the expectedly brilliant acting, there is also an unusual plot, camera work with stunning angles and bewitching music from a member of the Radiohead band.</p>
<p>Most of the films that we are used to watch are built around the plot. But The Master is a type of movie where plot doesn't play a central role. The attention of the viewer is drawn to psychology of the characters, disclosure of their personalities and motivations. Each scene and dialogue does not lead us to the next thing, but rather describes the character of a hero.</p>
<p>Former sailor Freddy Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), who went through the war, can not find his place in society. Switching aimlessly one work to another, Freddy accidentally makes an acquaintance with Mr. Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman) - a writer, physicist and leader of the religious and philosophical cult 'Mission'. And this encounter will become a turning point for Freddy.</p>
<p>The teachings of Lancaster Dodd are based on the fact that in every person's mind, memories of his past lives are preserved. If you mentally go back to painful moments from the past and go through them again, an impact of the existing psychosomatic disease can be reduced in the present. From time to time the head of the mission writes books which are meant to give answers to all life questions. Despite the fact that Dodd is a complete ignoramus in science, restless Freddy needs such a person who could act as an authority for him and a teacher who understands and sympathises with him. But even more than that, the teacher needs such student as Freddy - unstable, furious, vulgar, behaving like an animal.</p>
<p>For me personally, one of the most interesting moments in the film is the scene with psychological trainings. Especially the one where Freddy has to walk from a wall to window and just simply describe what he sees in front of him in such a detailed manner as possible. It turns out that such practice does really exist and is mentioned in scientific works of psychologists. Its essence is to overcome those psychological barriers that make us live in the past. Because of these barriers we often lose touch with reality and a current moment. This was what the master tried to do - help Freddy and force him to get to the root of his problems, recreate the past that prevents him from living on.</p>
<p>It is difficult to express a clear opinion about the film or narrow down the authorâ€™s idea. The Master turned out to be complex and rich, which, most likely, is already a Paul Thomas Anderson's calling card. There's a bunch of topics raised - a problem of self-fulfillment and an eternal dilemma of faith, friendship, devotion, mentorship, love, and many more. Everyone can get the film in their own way and highlight something important for themselves, and this is what makes it so outstanding.</p>
