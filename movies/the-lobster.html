            – Have you thought of what animal you’d like to be if you end up alone?<br />
– Yes, a lobster.<br />
– A lobster is an excellent choice.<br />

<p>As soon as I have come up with an idea to start this blog, I knew that &quot;The Lobster&quot; directed by Lanthimos Yorgos would be the first film I would review. It was probably the first arthouse film that did not leave me wondering &quot;What was that?&quot;, but made me think of society problems raised in the movie.</p>
<p>&quot;The Lobster&quot; is one of the best statements about our world, a brilliant dystopia which is unfolding at the present day.</p>
<p>Events occur in a fictional society, where all loners are sent to a special hotel. There they must find a partner in the allotted time, otherwise they will be turned into a chosen animal.</p>
<p>It is symbolic at the same time that the main character thinks that he could become a lobster, because it lives for a hundred years, can mate until old age and has blue blood like that of aristocrats.</p>
<p>Aren't these the ideals for a large number of modern people with aimless life?</p>
<p>Lantimos boldly displays the world of the present, its habits, rules of behavior, showing how absurd reality sometimes is, and how stupid can people look in it.</p>
<p>We should agree that our choices and our views are often formed under the pressure of society and stereotypes that have developed in it. It is thought that a person without a partner is inferior, that marriage can be saved with the help of children, that only black or white exists, etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a direct contrast between loneliness and pairedness in the film. There is an embodiment of both concepts of existence. But none of them gives freedom to an individual, none of them allows you to choose. Both suppress human nature. &quot;Free&quot; singles live in even greater fear than hotel residents. Their loneliness is not natural, it's an open opposition to the foundations of society, and confrontation is only for the sake of confrontation, and not for the sake of happiness.</p>
<p>Is it worth to be guided only by foundations and someone's opinion in such a serious choice as love? Is it worth to start a family just because it's meant to be so. Or vice versa - to remain alone only as a protest? The answer is even more obvious than it might seem at first glance.</p>
<p>Shooting of the film deserves a special attention. Color correction, acting, weird dialogs – everything creates the necessary atmosphere and emphasizes the main idea and message of the film.</p>
<p>Is it all in all worth watching? Definitely. And be sure to watch it again and try to unravel all the symbolisms and subtexts that the author lays almost in every scene. And the main thing is to understand to which extend this story is about us. And whether we ourselves have already turned into those very lobsters.</p>
