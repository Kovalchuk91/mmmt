<p>This film is a confession.
This film is a reflection.</p>
<p>This picture definitely cannot be attributed to traditional cinema. Inspired by the film <strong>&quot;8½&quot;</strong> by Frederico Fellini,
<strong>&quot;Mirror&quot;</strong> goes even further - there is no plot or story, the entire sequence of scenes is based only on the personal feelings of the author. Tarkovsky stated that he stopped only at the twenty-first version of the montage, completely discarding any logic in it.
Here everything is mixed up in one chaotic stream: memories, dreams, emotions, father's poems, mother's tears. Our consciousness works exactly the same way when we yearn for childhood, for a period that has now definitely passed the point of no return.</p>
<p>Tarkovsky paid attention to even the smallest details on the set, carefully building each element of the scenery. And this played a role. Each scene not only causes aesthetic pleasure, but it makes you believe. It's alive and breathful.</p>
<p>Separately, I would like to note the poems written by Tarkovsky's father, which sound throughout the film. Not only do they rhyme perfectly with the film itself and add drama to it, but they also play a huge role in reflecting the life of the author. His father left the family when Tarkovsky was still very young, and the future director will have to endure this departure all his life.
They say that when Tarkovsky's father saw the film, he was very surprised and said that he did not think that the divorce of parents had such a strong impact on his son.</p>
<blockquote>I don’t believe in omens, nor fear
foreboding signs. No poisons or lies
will strike me down. There is no death on earth;
everyone’s immortal. Nothing will die.
There’s no need to fear the end—at seventeen
or seventy. There’s only this life, this light
on earth; there’s no darkness or death.
We’re all already on the seashore,
and I’m one of those who hauls in the nets
when immortality swims past a shoal.

<p>If you have ever been nostalgic for your childhood, replayed events in your head, reliving them again and again, remembering the words of your parents, trying once again to understand what they meant, then probably you will be able see your reflection in the mirror too.</p>
<p>After the premiere, director of Goskino Filipp Yermash said the famous phrase: <em>&quot;Of course, we have a freedom of creativity, but that's too much.&quot;</em> Can you imagine a more flattering compliment?</p>
<p>And to end with, allow me to quote Tarkovskiy about the idea of the movie. This is that typical case when no one can say better then author himself:</p>
<blockquote>Our film is a process. It once occurred to a man that he was old, that it was time to think about the soul. He would be glad to believe in God, but he cannot.
And now he understands, realizes that everything was important in childhood, and everything that happened to him later was vanity. I want to make a picture of how a person, once waking up and looking at himself in the mirror, suddenly got scared - he suddenly realized that his life has been lived, that nothing has been done, and if earlier there was eternity before him, now everything is behind him.
But the main thing is not even in this, but in that a terrible question arose - why was all this, why all this life? For example, earlier it seemed to the hero that he was talented, but now he understands that he has only average abilities. Before, he seemed to understand what is infinity, what is eternity - and now he does not feel in himself the possibility of believing in God. He feels his existence as a trampling in place.
We are making a film about a man without God, a man who feels his disbelief as a tragic loss.
