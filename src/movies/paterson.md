Imagine that you are a director and you were offered a story about a bus driver. And no, terrorists are not trying to capture him, his first love will not take his bus by pure chance, and he will not even get in a car accident. The only thing that makes him different from any other bus driver is that he writes poetry. Without rhyme.

Sounds like the most boring movie ever, doesn't it?

However, this everyday life is our life and it is beautiful. Throughout the film we simply watch the life of a young man named Paterson from the town of the same name. The small world created by the director resembles the utopia of a pensioner who dreams of tranquility. Everything in it is on the one hand mundane and on the other insanely poetic. Every detail, be it the conversation of the bus passengers or the daily mug of beer in the bar, brings some special warmth, envelopes and entices, makes you want to drown and forget.

Such everyday life (empty at first and hasty glance) is the main point of the film. After all, we don't usually see picturesque landscapes from our apartment windows or ride the subway to work to the epic music of Hans Zimmer in the background.

The director does not impose his thoughts, truths, or philosophies on us, nor does he try to teach us or pander to us, but rather introduces us into a weightless state, allowing to interpret what is happening for ourselves. I think Tarkovsky would have loved this film, because he always said that cinema is the art of contemplation and that action kills cinema.

The modern world insistently singles out extraordinary people. At the same time, the small person (as most of us always have been) has become even smaller in the ever-growing scale of life. We have stopped dreaming of becoming astronauts and teachers. And a day in the life of a simple janitor is unlikely to gather many views and likes.

As high school and college students, we are inspired by showbiz stars, empathetic bloggers, and participants in short-lived flashy TV shows. We all wait and immaculately believe that a succession of unique events, accomplishments, and glories lies ahead of us as well. But what if it never happens? And is that so scary?

The director shows how important it is to find beauty even in the simplest things. It is possible to write a poem about a matchbox, to see something important in an empty notebook as a gift, to find comfort in the dragging rhythm of a small town, or to finally get into a movie without a twisted plot or exciting special effects.

Jarmusch showed the life of an ordinary man, as he sees it. What did he mean by that?
Maybe that the **simplest** touch of human life is sometimes the most **perfect**.
