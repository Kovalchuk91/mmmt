This is most likely not the movie review you expect to see in 2020. However, I still think it is relevant and I will definitely put it in my top and this is why.

"Groundhog Day" is a great example of a movie, the depth of which many people can miss behind the format of a light comedy. This film is probably known to everyone, almost everyone liked it, but I'm sure not everyone tried to analyze it deeply.

I would start with the title itself. "Groundhog Day". It's a typical day for most of us. The kind of day that doesn't promise anything extraordinary. Another day at work, which we would like to finish as soon as possible while waiting for weekdays, a vacation trip, a concert of our favorite band.

The routine and the feeling that we still have a lot of time dont allow us to realize the scale of one day. We are used to putting everything off for tomorrow and not attaching too much importance to small pieces of time. Throwing away a year is a pity, a month is tolerable, a day is not important. But a year doesn't just consist of days that are important to us. 90% of it are groundhog's days.

By the example of the protagonist, we see how diverse the same day can be. You can spend it as an ordinary stupid holiday, rob a bank, learn how to carve figures from the ice, get acquainted with a girl you have long liked. It can be a typical weekday or a day that can change your whole fate.

"Groundhog Day" is about the fact that everything genious is simple. It's about not giving up time, because in the end it's the most valuable thing we have. And 'tomorrow' may not come for us anymore. To appreciate every moment of life, to turn every day into little holidays - all this is within the power of each of us, so as not to live the day of the groundhog, the year of the groundhog and the life of the groundhog...
