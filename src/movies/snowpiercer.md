In 1984, a comic strip called "Le Transperceneige" was released in France. It tells about an environmental disaster that made life impossible on the planet. In order to survive some people were forced to fit on the train.

This story attracted attention of Korean director Pong Joon Ho, who made his own movie, which was in many ways distinguished from the French comic book. The result was not just a sci-fi picture on the topic of technogenic apocalypse, but a rather unusual film with many double meanings so obviously projected onto the global political system.


According to the plot, as in the original comic strip, all the surviving humanity is concentrated in one huge train which circulates through all continents. Thanks to the almost perpetual motion machine (which, of course, is considered to be "sacred") and its inventor Wilford (Ed Harris), people on the train hav opportunity to survive - there's severe frost, ice and snow outside. Mankind is dispersed into classes - representatives of the elite go to business class, well-fed bourgeois who bask in pools, saunas, dance in discos, sit in cafes and restaurants where even sushi are served, and in the lower class dregs are eating protein tiles. The revolutionaries under the command of Curtis (Chris Evans) have to go through the whole train and get to Wilford himself. Moreover, their path will be bloody, with fights and the use of axes, knives and firearms.

The entourage gives the film a special charm – it changes from wagon to wagon. And no one really knows what awaits brave rebels by the next door – an armed crowd or a garden with exotic flowers.
Here I want to note that quite often I came across complaints about the film, some logical gaps or inconsistencies in the arrangement of the train and actions of the heroes. In my opinion, this is absolutely not what you should pay attention to when watching it. This is a dystopian film, a metaphor. Plot errors or inaccuracies in the train's organisation are permissible. This is all just the entourage around the main idea of the film. With the same result, the heroes could move around an intergalactic ship – this would not in the least hinder the thoughts embedded in the film.

The film primarily discusses revolutions.

And, what is especially pleasing, it does not simply claim that revolutions are good or bad. It doesn't just show us revolutionary heroes who, with a fair level of pathos, die for the cause. No. Authors try to get to the essence of the revolutionary movements to show their versatility and inconsistency.
Are revolutions really capable of breaking the system? Are they always coming from the masses and are not someone else's manipulations? Or maybe they are just system's natural part? If people in the head of the train are replaced, will it change anything? Or the only way to break the system is to derail it?
The wagon system is a reflection of a class society with all that it implies. Here are those for whom the "Sacred Engine" is an unshakable ideal, a deity that they protect. And those for whom it is a symbol of oppression and poverty
The goal of people rising from the tail section is to achieve justice, to seize power over the train, get to the end at all costs. What this end will be is not so important, the main thing is to find out the answers to the questions that tormented him. But the answers will not entail anything other than a series of even more important questions, which will thereby create another vicious circle. Cyclicity and repetition, rebellion and confrontation, struggle and victory (but is it a victory?) – these are the main motives of the film.
Moving from car to car, heroes are faced with various manifestations of a class society – suppression apparatus, madness and decay of the elites, propaganda and brainwashing, the world of the rich in all its luxury and ugliness.
When the protagonist reached the head of train, he realised that his entire path had been planned in advance from above. Having won, he simultaneously lost, because the goal of the upper classes was to thin out the ranks of revolutionary-minded slaves. And in the end thanks to him it was fulfilled. Wilford offers the main character to become his successor and a head of the train as he fits this role like no other.
As a result, the Korean appeared to be right. Amid a flaming revolution on the train, he was looking for a way to break out of the system by gathering a grain of the key to liberation against the background of the heated masses who do not see that even in the revolution they remain only a squirrel in the wheel of the system. By derailing the train, in the only possible way he broke the established and decayed system and gave a chance for the emergence of a new world.
And it was the Korean who turned out to be a real revolutionary, and not the main character, who turned out to be not a revolutionary leader or religious messiah, but an ordinary puppet tormented by self-pity. The final fate of the train is the collapse of the old world in the only possible way, the collapse of the "state" swept away during the social revolution.
